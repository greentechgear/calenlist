## Create a New Calendar

It's recommended to create a dedicated calendar for events you want to share on Calenlist. This keeps your personal events separate and gives you more control over what you share.

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
2. Click the "+" button next to "Other calendars" in the sidebar
3. Select "Create new calendar"
4. Enter a name and description for your calendar
5. Click "Create calendar"

## Configure Calendar Settings

To make your calendar accessible through Calenlist, you need to make it public:

1. Find your calendar in the left sidebar
2. Click the three dots (â‹®) next to your calendar
3. Select "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll to "Access permissions for events"
5. Check "Make available to public"
6. Choose your sharing options:
   - "See all event details" - Recommended for most users
   - "See only free/busy" - Use this if you want to hide event details

## Get Calendar URL

To connect your calendar to Calenlist, you need its ICS URL:

1. In calendar settings, scroll to "Integrate calendar"
2. Find "Secret address in iCal format"
3. Click the "Copy" button next to the URL
   - The URL should look like: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/...`
   - Keep this URL private as it allows access to your calendar

## Add to Calenlist

Now you can add your calendar to Calenlist:

1. Go to your [Calenlist Dashboard](https://calenlist.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Add Calendar"
3. Paste your calendar's ICS URL
4. Fill in the remaining details
5. Click "Create Calendar"

## Important Notes

- **Privacy**: While your calendar is public, the ICS URL acts as a secret key. Don't share it directly.
- **Updates**: Changes in Google Calendar appear on Calenlist within a few minutes but can take longer.
- **Event Details**: 
  - Title and time are always visible
  - Description, location, and other details depend on your sharing settings
  - Private events stay private even if the calendar is public

## Troubleshooting

If your calendar isn't showing up:

1. Verify the calendar is set to public
2. Check that you copied the correct ICS URL
3. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
4. Try refreshing your browser
