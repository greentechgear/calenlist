## What does Calenlist mean?

**Short answer**: It combines "Calendar" and "List" - a simple way to list and share your calendars.

**Long answer**: We wanted a name that reflected both the simplicity and functionality of our platform. "Calen" comes from "Calendar" - the core of what we do, and "list" represents the act of sharing and organizing these calendars in an accessible way. Together, they form "Calenlist" - your hub for sharing calendars and building community.
